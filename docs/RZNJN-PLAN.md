# rZnjN

## Overview
rZnjN, pronounced "rez-engine", is an abbreviation for "Reznor Engine". It is the foundational technology upon which the CyberWorld Media Studios line of products are powered.

It is named after Trent Reznor and stylized to invoke Nine Inch Nails. It uses a J in its spelling to declare my own personal influence and signature. It's also meant to combine the concepts of an engine and a genie (or jinn).

In ancient Islamic and Jewish folklore, the jinn are the spirits of mischief and chaos. The word "jinn" is often spelled with a soft D (Djinn). In rZnjN, we use an N to reference Broken-era Nine Inch Nails.

## Regarding the n96 Project

### n96 Era Nine Inch Nails
The creative force driving the initial development and vision of rZnjN, as well as the inspiration for its envisioning, is the n96 Project. n96 was originally an attempt to answer the question: *"What if Nine Inch Nails had released an album in 1996"*. In the wake of The Downward Spiral and the supporting Self Destruct Tour, Trent Reznor had a lot of pressure to release a follow-up Nine Inch Nails album. Instead, he focused on other musical projects and collaborations including the Natural Born Killers soundtrack, multiple remix EPs and albums, scoring the music and effects for the game Quake, the Lost Highway soundtrack, and most notably Marilyn Manson's Smells Like Children and Antichrist Superstar albums.

### Source Material
Traces of what The Downward Spiral follow-up album might have sounded like can be found across all of these works. Even the Manson releases were largely written, performed, and produced by Reznor and members of his touring band (Chris Vrenna, Danny Lohner, and Charlie Clouser). Also, while The Fragile would be released several years later and feature a drastic change in style and direction, it does retain many elements left over from the n96 era. 

### The n96 Vision
The n96 project attempts to imagine an alternate reality where The Downward Spiral follow-up album was released in 1996. It then proceeds to deconstruct all of these works and synthesize them into their constituent parts, where they could be remixed into musical pieces and songs that might have been included in the follow-up album. 

### The rZnjN Technology
The rise of generative AI has resurrected the n96 concept as a valuable test case for producing alternate possible histories in music. 

### The Tokien Factor
Being primarily a linguist by profession, J.R.R. Tolkien set out to invent fictional languages. In order to do this authentically, he had to study the languages of the world, their history, and their grammar. rZnjN sets out to do this with music. While generative AI has been able to produce music that perfectly mimics real human musical artists, (particularly those for which vast amounts of training data is available), it has not been able to produce music that is authentically human in its own right. My theory is that by providing sufficient context for the personal history of the artist, including crucial relationships and shared experiences with other humans, the AI can produce music that is authentically human. It may even be possible for the AI to deeply understand the parts of the human experience that its musical content is expressing. In order to produce authentic languages, Tolkien had to write the Lord of the Rings and the history of the Elves and their war with Morgoth going all the way back to an entire creation myth. We should expect that in order to generate authentic music, we will need to provide much more than just samples of existing music. We will need to invent an entire music scene and culture that emerges out of a well-defined social environment with specific personalities and relationships.

### Why Nine Inch Nails and why 1996?
While the ultimate goal is to produce a robust fictional music scene history, a meaningful step forward is to identify "what if" scenarios where a clear historical vacuum exists with solid traces of what might have been and a personal connection to the material. The n96 concept has a strong score on all of these criteria. I spent two years during a formative period of my life anticipating this fictional record and many years since revisiting the material of this era and imagining what it might have sounded like. Another factor, would be the fan remix community. Nine Inch Nails has a strong and active community of fans who have been remixing and reimagining the music for decades. This project could stoke excitement among these fans and drive user engagement that would provide additional data sources. NIN is also a very technology oriented band with a history of experimenting with new technologies, tools, and media platforms. They helped drive the deepening of integration of music in video games, especially in the shooter genre. They even experimented with a game development project at one point. Furthermore, Reznor has done a lot to encourage fan remixes by releasing constituent tracks from some of his recordings and even going so far as to release entire albums under open source licenses. They even collaborated with an EDM producer on their recent tour to remix classic songs live on stage during performances.

### Other Such "What If" Scenarios

***Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace***: This one may actually be even better because of the extensive community of fans who wondered the same thing for much longer and have much more material to draw from.ß

## Product Ideas for CyberWorld Media Studios
The following is a list of potential products or functionality that could either be built upon the rZnjN or be used to build and improve it. 

- **DrumNote**: Generate drum notation from audio files or samples. Takes audio input, separates it into stems to isolate the drum track, then analyzes the drums to generate standardized drum notation.
- **NotePulse**: Generate beats from drum notation input. Input any standard drum notation and generate an example beat to demonstrate how it would sound.
- **BeatScribe**: A drum notation editor super-charged with generative AI. Start dropping notes on the grid and get suggestions for rhythms and fills as you go. Or enter in a prompt to kick start your creative process.
